    <h1>
        UNTOLD STORY BEHIND NIGERIAN POLITICS
    </h1>
    <h2>The Rough Edges of Tribalism</h2>
    <P>The Nigerian problem currently is its structure — the concentration of exclusive powers in the centre,
        in an unrefined ethnic-religious-conscious state.
        I stand with whosoever says that the Nigerian problem did not begin with the amalgamation of the south and north
        of the country
        by the British colonial authorities, because the country was governed, I dare say, successfully, by the
        different Governors-General that represented the British Crown.
        Our problems partly began when religious and ethnic sentiments, schemed in Ibadan, were used in an attempt to
        achieve a coalition. This was in January 1950,
        during what is known today as the Constitutional Review Conference, which brought for the first time (Jose, 32)
        the leaders of the amalgamated northern and southern regions,
        split at the time of the conference into three — east, west, and north — by the very constitution being
        reviewed. After rejecting the ministerial system of government proposed at the conference,
        the northern leaders, invited by the Yoruba leaders staying in what was called Catering Rest House,
        Ibadan, sat in a meeting.</P>

    <h3>There was Greed or Ignorance</h3>
    <p>he problems that destabilised Nigeria were not at all created during and after the Nigerian Civil War. It partly
        began with the excesses of the Action Group.
        It is the abolition of the true federation, practised in the country, by Major General Aguiyi Ironsi, that dealt
        the greatest blow to everything about Nigeria.
        It is this unfortunate move by Ironsi that brought the “ethnically negative” minds out to raised the alarm that
        the Igbo were on the verge of dominating other groups in the country.
        This explanation was reasonable to the untutored minds who were fully aware that it was the bloody coup
        championed by some Igbo soldiers that brought Aguiyi Ironsi, an Igbo, to power, and with this power,
        Ironsi took away the powers vested on the regions of the country, and arrogated them to himself. The fear roused
        by this deed raised the same cries heard in the backward societies watching dragons of darkness from the moon
        swifting to boot off the sun,
        the light, the sustainer of life, to cause perpetual darkness enjoyed by the moon. It first claimed Ironsi’s own
        life before it went down swiftly and claimed the lives of innocent citizens of the eastern origin,
        especially the Igbo, who could hardly say what Ironsi did or what it meant. But ironically, the exclusive powers
        which Ironsi greedily or ignorantly instituted are still there, threatening the existence of the country.
        If Ironsi was killed for arrogating exclusive powers to himself, and those who killed him are today using those
        powers to ride the country to the directions of their choice, opposing directly and indirectly the call to
        restructure the country, isn’t it absurd?</p>
    <br>

    <h2>Extremism — The Deadly Edge</h2>
    <p>It is the excesses emanating from the use of exclusive powers to direct the affairs of the country that made a
        good number call for the devolution of political powers to the regions of the country.
        Those opposing this campaign are not ignorant of the fact that restoring the powers of the regions will not only
        send all the battling groups in Abuja back to their regions,
        but will bring back the competition that had uplifted the country. The Muslim north, the only region opposing
        this campaign, is not ignorant of the good things this restructuring will cause.
        It believes that with its ‘huge’ population, in this democratic era, it has conquered the Christian south, since
        no one from the south will ever win any presidential election in the country without depending on the ‘huge’
        population of the north.
        It accepted the hapless rotation of power between the north and south because it knows it is only anyone it
        supports from the south that wins and leads the country. The south in this sense is a conquered territory.
        A lot of things have made this clear: the politicians from the south have never challenged the ‘huge’ number of
        voters in the north, which the media and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) always project.
        Few months to the 2023 general election, a man named Nasirus Idris was arrested and jailed by a magistrate court
        in Sokoto for possessing about one hundred and one registered voter cards,
        and another arraigned for possessing about three hundred and sixty seven registered voter cards in Kano. These
        two are definitely not alone in this criminality.
        There must be thousands of others, each with hundreds of registered voter cards, waiting to cast hundreds of
        votes on the election day in the north.
        And we have heard many times about thousands of Hausa-speaking strangers from Nigér and Chad trooping into the
        country to register for voter cards, and to vote for any presidential candidate favoured by the Muslim north.
        With this, the north determines who leads the country. And the conquered territory, the south, knows, and allows
        this anomaly. There is absolutely nothing it can do about the criminal activities of the INEC in the north,
        the corrupt voting system, and the borders that are thrown open for roaming strangers from the desert to troop
        in and register for voter cards, and to vote with them in Nigeria. It rather strives for the admiration of the
        same region that leans heavily on deception against the south.
        This is why many political leaders from the south have opposed and accepted what they shouldn’t about the
        country just to satisfy and remain relevant to the north. For instance, Muhammadu Buhari’s disastrous Operation
        Python Dance II,
        which claimed the lives of many young, unarmed agitators in the south east, was fully endorsed by a good number
        of Igbo politicians who believed they were relevant to the federal government, and must remain the same by not
        “interfering”
        in the desires of the Muhammadu Buhari administration in the south east. At least some of the political elders
        in the Igbo-socio-cultural organisation, Ohaneze, gave a reason for keeping mute during the killings.
        They said they were ignored and even insulted when they commanded the protesters to stop (that is, to stop
        angering and horrifying Muhammadu Buhari with their protests against his nepotism — enthronment of Muslims and
        the Fulani in the country).
        So the monster found himself unopposed in the entire south east. He strutted freely, and heavily, using his
        weapon, the Nigerian army, to gun down any group of young men and women he could set his eyes on.
        Many in the south east found themselves standing helplessly at the graves of brilliant young men and women whose
        offence was their constitutional rights they exercised in the country.</p>


    <h2> Examplars</h2>
    <p> There are great names that have not been honoured, or honoured enough.
        A bitter culture among Nigerians is the tendency to remember and reward goodness when those who exhibited it are
        no more.
        Remove this custom, the likes of Olusegun Obasanjo will be heroes. The reason is simply because Olusegun
        Obasanjo never
        in his service years to Nigeria made himself a tribal hero.
        He may have victimised many of those who opposed his attempt to retain power in 2007, and may have been charged
        with corruption,
        but these, as disturbing as they are, are never a grave threat to the unity of Nigeria as tribalism and, the
        worst,
        religious extremism storming now from the north. And the wars and conflicts he ended and prevented on our
        continent speak for him. He is, at the moment,
        the best leader that Nigeria has had. He is followed by the late Umaro Musa Yar’Adua, whose brief stay in power
        saw the welfare of the country uplifted.
        Yar’Adua was a fine Muslim, educated, detribalised, upright, and transparent. By diplomatically defeating the
        Niger Delta militants with his amnesty programme,
        he demonstrated how discerning he was in a difficult country like ours. Goodluck Ebele Jonathan is the next
        admired leader Nigeria has had. If he had restructured the country,
        and amended the 1999 Constitution,
        as suggested by the National Conference he convoked in 2014, he would have had a broader place in history.</p>
